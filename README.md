# Hardhat Smart Contract Lottery

Lotteries require true randomness. In this project, I aim to create a decentralised lottery that anyone can enter. True randomness for the lottery is achieved through the use of the Chainlink oracle as on-chain methods to derive randomness are not truly random and thus allowing the lottery to be gamed otherwise.

Scripts have also been added to deploy the contract

Features:

1. Anyone can enter the contract
2. Oracles are used to achieve true randomness
3. Lottery closes after a certain amount of time
4. Contract automatically allocates winnings to winner
